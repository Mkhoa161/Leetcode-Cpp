# Leetcode-Python
My solutions to leetcode problems surrounding data structures such as array, string, linked list and binary tree.
There are many algorithms used in dealing with those data structures.
For string and array, I utilize many interesting techniques and algorithms such as prefix sum, two pointers, sliding window and even dynamic programming.
For linked list and binary tree, I focus on utilizing recursion, DFS, BFS, fast and slow pointers, and many other algorithms.
